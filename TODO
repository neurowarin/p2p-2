BUGS

-Add a stop function to the server to stop the server thread. Make it so servers
can be properly created and destroyed.


NEEDED FEATURES

-Work on migrating functions which should be generic to download. Work on
clientBuffer interaction with download.

-There should be a 1 second timer that makes the clientBuffer wait
between requests of the last block.

-exploration should be moved inside the client.

-client_buffer needs to be generalized.

-documentation on all the gui ctor stuff and header stuff needs to be done.


DEFERRED FEATURES

-Needs to be a check so that when the user tries to download the same thing
twice the second download doesn't get appended to the first. Make a database
to store downloaded file information to check against.


IDEAS

-File location should be done with trackers which are organized in to a tree
structure such that if the user adds a tracker the user will also get to see
the files of the trackers that tracker trusts and the files that that tracker
trusts etc. Have an option to limit trust levels to direct trust only, one
level inheritance and all level inheritance.

-A hash tree should be used to minimize the amount of data a person has to get
from an authoritative source. Template bst, add function to retrieve child
tree nodes.
