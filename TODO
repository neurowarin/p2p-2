BUGS AND NECESSARY FEATURES

-If two downloads are added with a very small interval of time between them
an extra socket is opened to the same host if there is already a socket open
to that host.

-There needs to be a check so that when the user tries to download the same thing
twice the second download doesn't get appended to the first.

-The IP addresses don't update when servers go missing. There should be some
indication under the IP field that IP's are being searched for. Make it say
"searching..";


POSSIBLE FEATURES

-Function to reduce fdmax when sockets are closed.

-A timer on all servers that keeps track of time of request to time of response
or fulfilled request. A way to disconnect servers that are unresponsive.

-Client has no control of how many connections it will try to make. This
feature can be added once exploration is working.

-Add a check to make sure the client is not requesting the same blocks over
and over(trying to waste bandwidth to degrade serving capability).

-Have the serverIndex poll to check for new files added to share.


IDEAS

-Exploration belongs in the client class, not out on it's own.

-Derive the download class from class X. Virtualize functions in class X. This 
will allow you to make other classes and derive them from class X which will 
allow downloading of different things with different buffer sizes.

-File location should be done with trackers which are organized in to a tree
structure such that if the user adds a tracker the user will also get to see
the files of the trackers that tracker trusts and the files that that tracker
trusts etc. Have an option to limit trust levels to direct trust only, one
level inheritance and all level inheritance.
