BUGS AND NECESSARY FEATURES

-There needs to be a check so that when the user tries to download the same thing
twice the second download doesn't get appended to the first.

-Fix includes, change from " " to < > and have the proper linker statements.

POSSIBLE FEATURES

-A server timeout for servers that accept requests but never respond.

-Client control of how many outgoing connections it will try to make.

-Have the serverIndex poll to check for new files added to share.


IDEAS

-Exploration belongs in the client class, not out on it's own.

-Derive the download class from class X. Virtualize functions in class X. This 
will allow you to make other classes and derive them from class X which will 
allow downloading of different things with different buffer sizes.

-File location should be done with trackers which are organized in to a tree
structure such that if the user adds a tracker the user will also get to see
the files of the trackers that tracker trusts and the files that that tracker
trusts etc. Have an option to limit trust levels to direct trust only, one
level inheritance and all level inheritance.
