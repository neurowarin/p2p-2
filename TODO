BUGS

-Add a stop function to the server to stop the server thread. Make it so servers
can be properly created and destroyed.

-Unreliable client test bugged. Last packet not getting written to file.


HARD BUGS

-download_file has it's last block requested multiple times from all connected
server. The super_block idea needs to be trashed in favor of something else.
Perhaps a reverse priority queue with rules based on how big it gets.


DEFERRED FEATURES

-Needs to be a check so that when the user tries to download the same thing
twice the second download doesn't get appended to the first. Make a database
to store downloaded file information to check against.


IDEAS

-File location should be done with trackers which are organized in to a tree
structure such that if the user adds a tracker the user will also get to see
the files of the trackers that tracker trusts and the files that that tracker
trusts etc. Have an option to limit trust levels to direct trust only, one
level inheritance and all level inheritance.
