TODO

-Add rerequest feature.

-Add a stop function to the server to stop the server thread. Make it so servers
can be properly created and destroyed.

-Add a client_buffer feature to allow download to check for errors.

-Determine if the server speed calculation requires a deque. Will a queue do?

-Add a check for PIPELINE_SIZE * C_MAX_SIZE in the server.


BUGS

-Upload speed is incorrect.


DEFERRED FEATURES

-Needs to be a check so that when the user tries to download the same thing
twice the second download doesn't get appended to the first. Make a database
to store downloaded file information to check against.


IDEAS

-File location should be done with trackers which are organized in to a tree
structure such that if the user adds a tracker the user will also get to see
the files of the trackers that tracker trusts and the files that that tracker
trusts etc. Have an option to limit trust levels to direct trust only, one
level inheritance and all level inheritance.


PORTABILITY PROBLEMS

-Paths have forward slashes in them in globals.h, read boost::filesystem docs
and fix this you lazy slog.

-Casting BS.to_ulong() to a char in conversion.h is not portable between
architectures of different endianness.

-close() is called closesocket() on windows.
