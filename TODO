TODO

-Add rerequest feature.

-Add a stop function to the server to stop the server thread. Make it so servers
can be properly created and destroyed.

-Add a client_buffer feature to allow download to check for errors.

-The latency block requester in download_file is broken since pipelineing was
implemented.

-See if the integer fields in sqlite DB are large enough.


BUGS

-Upload speed is incorrect. Redo algorithm.

-Problem with downloads missing a packet and buffering huge. The error is
non-deterministic.


DEFERRED FEATURES

-Needs to be a check so that when the user tries to download the same thing
twice the second download doesn't get appended to the first. This will naturally
be added when hashes are checked. If a file we want to download has a root hash
that exists in the hashes folder then file was already downloaded.


IDEAS

-File location should be done with trackers which are organized in to a tree
structure such that if the user adds a tracker the user will also get to see
the files of the trackers that tracker trusts and the files that that tracker
trusts etc. Have an option to limit trust levels to direct trust only, one
level inheritance and all level inheritance.


PORTABILITY PROBLEMS

-Paths have forward slashes in them in globals.h, read boost::filesystem docs
and fix this.

-Casting BS.to_ulong() to a char in conversion.h is not portable between
architectures of different endianness.

-close() is called closesocket() on windows.
