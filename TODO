TODO

-It seems like with the speed limiter that some servers can get starved of send
time.

-The sleep damper is taking ~10 seconds to kick in. There is high CPU usage
immediately after changing bandwidth limit.

-Currently no logic to disconnect abusive servers.

-Finish connection gui_preferences to client and server.

DEFERRED FEATURES

-Think about combining hash tree's in to one file. Maybe put them in DB? It's
not reasonable to have one hash tree file sitting on the HDD for every file
shared. Another possibility is some sort of compression library that'd give
access to a file like it's in a directory, does zlib do this?


IDEAS

-File location should be done with trackers which are organized in to a tree
structure such that if the user adds a tracker the user will also get to see
the files of the trackers that tracker trusts and the files that that tracker
trusts etc. Have an option to limit trust levels to direct trust only, one
level inheritance and all level inheritance. Children should be able to point
to their parents.

-Don't allow people to download who have the P2P port blocked. Make a ping
command the server can send to the client. The client should return a pong
otherwise it doesn't get to download.

-Let the user set up bandwidth profiles that can be quickly selected. The user
could create one for games/night time/bla bla. Then have a timer that can select
the profile based on time of day.

-Implement the minix scheduler in the client_bufffer. Three ring buffers. The
first ring spins 5 times before letting the second ring spin once. The second
ring spins 5 times before letting the third ring spin once. After a download
has been served from rings one or two 5 times it gets moved to a lower ring.
The idea behind this is that bulk jobs (download_file's) get a much lower
priority than short jobs.
