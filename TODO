TODO

-Think about making a SHA1 implementation. Strong suspicions that the one being
used is slow.

-When a connection to a server fails pending connection attempts for that server
should be stopped.

-The client_buffer needs to be adjusted to pipeline more when sending commands
that expect smaller responses. This needs some thought because downloads might
expect different responses. Perhaps add a function to downloads that returns
their max possible response size and operate on that.

-Hash trees for missing files need to be deleted.

-Hashes need to be regenerated for files that have changed size (files hashed
while they were copying).


IDEAS

-File location should be done with trackers which are organized in to a tree
structure such that if the user adds a tracker the user will also get to see
the files of the trackers that tracker trusts and the files that that tracker
trusts etc. Have an option to limit trust levels to direct trust only, one
level inheritance and all level inheritance.

-Don't allow people to download who have the P2P port blocked. Make a ping
command the server can send to the client. The client should return a pong
otherwise it doesn't get to download.

-Let the user set up bandwidth profiles that can be quickly selected. The user
could create one for games/night time/bla bla. Then have a timer that can select
the profile based on time of day.
