DEFERRED FEATURES

-Needs to be a check so that when the user tries to download the same thing
twice the second download doesn't get appended to the first. This will naturally
be added when hashes are checked. If a file we want to download has a root hash
that exists in the hashes folder then the file was already downloaded.

-The download needs to remove a file from the DB when it receives a P_FNF. It
needs to delay a request when a P_DNE is received.


IDEAS

-File location should be done with trackers which are organized in to a tree
structure such that if the user adds a tracker the user will also get to see
the files of the trackers that tracker trusts and the files that that tracker
trusts etc. Have an option to limit trust levels to direct trust only, one
level inheritance and all level inheritance.
