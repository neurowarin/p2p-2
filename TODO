BUGS AND NECESSARY FEATURES

-Need to use writefds in the client for requests(even though requests are real
small a malicious person could exploit it).

-Needs to be a check so that when the user tries to download the same thing
twice the second download doesn't get appended to the first. Make a database
to store downloaded file information to check against.

-Need a server timeout for servers that accept requests but never respond.

-Client control of how many outgoing connections it will try to make.

-Have the serverIndex poll to check for new files added to share.


IDEAS

-File location should be done with trackers which are organized in to a tree
structure such that if the user adds a tracker the user will also get to see
the files of the trackers that tracker trusts and the files that that tracker
trusts etc. Have an option to limit trust levels to direct trust only, one
level inheritance and all level inheritance.
