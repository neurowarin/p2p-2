TODO

-Pass the phoney socket_data back to failed_call_back
-Make wrapper for send()/recv() that takes a socket and a buffer.
-Generating prime PRNG needs to be fast PRNG, not /dev/urandom. That should only
be used to seed the fast PRNG. Miller-Rabin test count needs to be adjusted
according to how big the prime is.
-Get rid of all C style casting.
-P2P program can be opened multiple times.


DEFERRED FEATURES

-Using new primes must be forced. To do this old primes must be kept track of.
-Requests should be sent before file blocks, when two hosts download from
eachother the file blocks hog upload that should be used to get requests out.
-SQLite blob write offset is a signed int. This limits the maximum tree size
to 2gB. Create document like this: http://www.sqlite.org/limits.html with size
limits.
-Support for multiple share directories.
-Figure out how to handle naming conflicts. It should be fully automatic.
Probably just rename the files according to some rules. It doesn't matter too
much since the hashes stay the same.
-Have a tab that shows share stats, upload/download stats, duplicate files, etc.
-Make sure program works when out of hard drive space.
