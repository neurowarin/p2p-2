BUGS AND NECESSARY FEATURES

-serverIndex.cc line 188-194 move to ctor

-Have the download::writeBlock function just write the trailing superBlock
with not parameter passed in to it. If it fails hash check remove it.

-There needs to be a check so that when the user tries to download the same thing
twice the second download doesn't get appended to the first.


POSSIBLE FEATURES

-A timer on all servers that keeps track of time of request to time of response
or fulfilled request. A way to disconnect servers that are unresponsive.

-Client has no control of how many connections it will try to make. This
feature can be added once exploration is working.

-Add a check to make sure the client is not requesting the same blocks over
and over(trying to waste bandwidth to degrade serving capability).

-Have the serverIndex poll to check for new files added to share.


IDEAS

-Make the hash database like a streaming filesystem where every hash field points
to the next hash field. The file format should be fixed length where the pointer
to the record stored at the end of each record is a RRN.

-Exploration belongs in the client class, not out on it's own.

-Make a tracker that is basically a web server. The tracker will serve XML files
and track who's connected to the download. The tracker will trust other trackers
to form a tree or trust.

-Derive the download class from class X. Virtualize functions in class X. This 
will allow you to make other classes and derive them from class X which will 
allow downloading of different things with different buffer sizes.

-Consider using a bitset to convert fileBlock numbers in to base 2 to maximize
usage of bytes sent over the network.
