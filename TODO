TODO

-It's possible for sockets to get reused before a remove_socket_data is called
causing the precondition to be violated.
-Generating prime PRNG needs to be fast PRNG, not /dev/urandom. That should only
be used to seed the fast PRNG. Miller-Rabin test count needs to be adjusted
according to how big the prime is.
-P2P program can be opened multiple times. Make lock file.

REACTOR IDEA
	Have reactor_* keep socket_data in map. Map can be used to iterated through to check
sockets so that it's not possible to f'up and check a socket a worker is using.
When doing call back the socket_data should be removed from the map and passed
to a reactor call back scheduler function. The act of passing the socket_data
from the reactor_select to the reactor transfers control of the socket data.
	socket_data with the failed_connect_flag or disconnect_flag set should not
be passed back to the reactor_select when the reactor is done with it. The
reactor_select needs to make sure the socket was disconnected before scheduling
the call back.


DEFERRED FEATURES

-Using new primes must be forced. To do this old primes must be kept track of.
-Requests should be sent before file blocks, when two hosts download from
eachother the file blocks hog upload that should be used to get requests out.
-SQLite blob write offset is a signed int. This limits the maximum tree size
to 2gB. Create document like this: http://www.sqlite.org/limits.html with size
limits.
-Support for multiple share directories.
-Figure out how to handle naming conflicts. It should be fully automatic.
Probably just rename the files according to some rules. It doesn't matter too
much since the hashes stay the same.
-Have a tab that shows share stats, upload/download stats, duplicate files, etc.
-Make sure program works when out of hard drive space.
