THINK ABOUT

-Think about CMWC4096 PRNG seed issue. After key exchange, each client/server
sends 1/2 the size of the PRNG seed encrypted to the other.

-Think about how ISP might detect protocol via knowing handshake size/port.
Initial send sizes need to be be randomized? Perhaps do a modulo of some number
against the secret key, this could say how many extra random bytes to send.

-Possible system to do uploads. Favor the highest request, but assure that
requests are arriving sequentially.

-Is starvation a problem between the client and server upload?


DEFERRED FEATURES

-When connecting to a server have the client send it's host key and then the
server send it's host key. Both the client and server should look to see if a
key has been negotiated with the other before. If it has the client can just
start sending without negotating a new key. Defer this feature until GUIDs
are worked out.

-client::set_download_directory() not doing anything but saving setting.

-Support for multiple share directories.

-Figure out how to handle naming conflicts. It should be fully automatic.
Probably just rename the files according to some rules. It doesn't matter too
much since the hashes stay the same.

-Have a directory where partially downloaded files reside. When a file finishes
downloading it can be moved to a directory which can be indexed normally. This
way users can rename files and do what they want and files will just get
rehashed without complication.

-Have a tab that shows share stats, upload/download stats, duplicate files, etc.
