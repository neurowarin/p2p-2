BUGS


NEEDED FEATURES

-Something to account for the burst of rerequests the client makes
when at the end of a file.

-There probably needs to be a distinction made between completed and stopped
downloads. Like what happens with the partial file from a stopped download?


DEFERRED FEATURES

-Needs to be a check so that when the user tries to download the same thing
twice the second download doesn't get appended to the first. Make a database
to store downloaded file information to check against.


IDEAS

-File location should be done with trackers which are organized in to a tree
structure such that if the user adds a tracker the user will also get to see
the files of the trackers that tracker trusts and the files that that tracker
trusts etc. Have an option to limit trust levels to direct trust only, one
level inheritance and all level inheritance.

-The protocol for sending information for a file should be 1 byte command,
2 byte packet length, the rest of the packet will be variable length.
