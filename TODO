BUGS AND NECESSARY FEATURES

-Need a server timeout for servers that accept requests but never respond and
never disconnect. A person could exploit this by taking up slots but no bandwidth.

-Client control of how many outgoing connections it will try to make.

-Have the serverIndex poll to check for new files added to share.

-The client::terminateDownload is missing locks, and it's calling functions aren't
locking properly either.

-The server sendPending needs to operate like the client sendPending.


DEFERRED FEATURES

-Needs to be a check so that when the user tries to download the same thing
twice the second download doesn't get appended to the first. Make a database
to store downloaded file information to check against.


PERFORMANCE OBSERVANCES

-With multiple downloads transfer speed also decreases. I suspect it's because
the servers have to seeks to different files often. mmap? Use the boost::iostream
library to set up a mapped file.

-I'm doing a erase on my network buffer when it shouldn't be necessary. I could
just write over the existing bytes and keep track of how many I've sent.


IDEAS

-File location should be done with trackers which are organized in to a tree
structure such that if the user adds a tracker the user will also get to see
the files of the trackers that tracker trusts and the files that that tracker
trusts etc. Have an option to limit trust levels to direct trust only, one
level inheritance and all level inheritance.

-The protocol for sending information for a file should be 1 byte command, 2 byte
packet length, the rest of the packet will be variable length.

-If I moved the downloads in to the serverElements then I could get rid of the
Server container within the downloads simplifying things a lot. The serverElements
would still be in a buffer accessed by
