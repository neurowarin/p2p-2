	When a message needs to be sent it is inserted in to the Send_Queue. Some
	messages are prioritized by being inserted closer to the front of the queue.

	Priority:
		The commands are also priorities. The higher the command number the higher
	the priority.

	Explanation of Priority:
		Establishing a slot to download is prioritized above all else because we
	want to get the download running ASAP. Sending the SLOT_ID to a remote host
	is prioritized next because we want uploads to get started ASAP.
		The requests for blocks are prioritized above sending hash_tree and file
	blocks to avoid a starvation problem that can happen when two hosts with
	asymmetric connections download from eachother concurrently. This starvation
	problem happens without prioritization because requests for new data from the
	remote end get stuck behind sending the huge hash_tree and file blocks.

	Insertion Algorithm:
	1. Insert message at the end of the deque.
	2. If message at current location - 1 is lower priority then swap. If current
	   location is beginning, or location - 1 is equal or greater priority then
	   stop.
	3. goto 2
