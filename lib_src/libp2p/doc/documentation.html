<b>1.0 Abstract</b>
<blockquote>
The libp2p library provides the means to connect to a global DHT (distributed
hash table) on which to lookup and download files from multiple hosts
concurrently.
</blockquote>

<b>2.0 Protocol</b>
<blockquote>
The protocol is symmetric with the exception of the key exchange. Any message
can go in either direction. All numbers are encoded in big-endian.
</blockquote>

<b>2.1 Key Exchange</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Each session starts with a Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange.

Host_A initiates a connection with Host_B.
g   = the generator both sides use that is always equal to 2
s_A = secret exponent of Host_A
s_B = secret exponent of Host_B
p   = prime Host_A generates that both sides use
r_A = result of Host_A, g^s_A % p
r_B = result of Host_B, g^s_B % p
k   = secret key
MiM = Man in the middle.
^   = exponentiation symbol
%   = modulo symbol

The section header indicates who sees what.
+-----------------+   +-----------------+   +-----------------+
|     Host_A      |   |       MiM       |   |      Host_B     |
+-----------------+   +-----------------+   +-----------------+
| k = r_B^s_A % p | = | g^(s_A*s_B) % p | = | r_A^s_B % p = k |
+-----------------+   +-----------------+   +-----------------+
</pre>

Step 0: Host_A sends p and r_A to Host_B.

+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|       P       |      r_A      |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  0    ...   15  16    ...   31
</pre>
</fieldset>

<br>

<fieldset>
<pre>
Step 1: Host_B receives what was sent in Step 0. Host_B sends r_B to Host_A.

+---+---+---+---+
|      r_B      |
+---+---+---+---+
  0    ...   15
</pre>
</fieldset>

<br>

<fieldset>
<pre>
Step 2: Host_A receives what was sent in Step 1.
Both sides now have all information needed to calculate the secret key.
</pre>
</fieldset>

<br>

<p>
The secret key is used to seed two KISS (created by George Marsaglia) PRNGs. One
PRNG is for sending and one is for receiving. Note that the KISS PRNG is not
cryptographically secure but this is okay because the goal is obfuscation and
not security. Key exchanges without a PKI (public key infrastructure) is
inherently insecure.
</p>

|       x       |       y       |       z       |       c       |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15

//KISS
uint32_t x, y, z, c;
uint32 extract()
{
	uint64 t, a = 698769069;
	x = 69069 * x + 12345;
	y ^= (y << 13);
	y ^= (y >> 17);
	y ^= (y << 5);
	t = a * z + c;
	c = (t >> 32);
	return x + y + (z = t);
}
</pre>

<p>
After the PRNG is seeded all bytes sent and received are XOR'd against the
output of the PRNGs. The send PRNG of Host_A remains synchronized to the recv
PRNG of Host_B and vise versa.

<b>2.5 Pipelining</b>
<blockquote>
<p>
Pipelining is done by sending multiple requests, and a new request whenever a
response is received. This increases throughput because the sender will never be
idle waiting for a request.
</p>
<p>
The maximum allowed pipeline size is 16. This would saturate a link with a
delay throughput product of less than 163840 (10240 * 16) bytes. For example, a
6Mb/s connection would have to have a latency greater than 213ms to not
saturate. This number is highly arbitrary and factors in buffering size, and

</p>
<b>Adaptive Pipeline Sizing Algorithm:</b>
<p>
This simple algorithm reduces the size of the pipeline to the minimum needed
without reducing throughput.
</p>
<pre>
Run after request fulfilled to adjust pipeline size.

C = current requests unfulfilled (requests in pipeline)
M = maximum pipeline size (this is what we adjust)
A = absolute maximum pipeline size (M always < A)

case: C == 0 && M < A
	//pipeline is too small, increase by one
	++M
case: C == 1
	//pipeline size optimal, do nothing
case: C > 1 && M > 1
	//pipeline is too large, decrease by one
	--M;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<b>2.6 Hash Tree</b>
<blockquote>

<p>
Merkle Hash Trees are used to distribute downloading of hash data needed to
verify the integrity of file blocks. The hash "function" used to generate the
tree is SHA1.
</p>

<p>
The bottom row of the tree consists of hashes for every 10240 bytes of the file
(however the last block may be shorter). Every row above the bottom row consists
of hashes for blocks of 512 hashes in the row below it (the last hash may be
for less than 512 child hashes).
</p>

<p>
When the row generation process generates a row of one hash the file size
(encoded in big endian) is prepended to that hash, then that is hashed to
produce the hash the files will be tracked by.
</p>

<p>
The hash tree is addressible by hash blocks. Hash block 0 is the root hash
of the tree with the file size prepended. Hash block 1 is the group of hashes
in the second row that the root hash is a hash for. The hash blocks are not
relative record numbers so to know the size of each block when downloading tree
building must be simulated to determine how many bytes are in each hash block.
</p>

<b>3.0 Building</b>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<b>3.1 GNU/Linux</b>
<blockquote>
<p>
There are many different GNU/Linux distributions. Most likely you can use your
package manager to install the developer versions of these packages: boost, and
gtkmm.
</p>
</blockquote>

<b>3.2 Windows</b>
<blockquote>
<p>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/">Visual C++ Express 2008</a><br>
The command line compiler will be used by scons. It is not necessary to register
unless one wants to use the IDE.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.boostpro.com/products/free">Boost</a> &#62;= 1.36<br>
Precompiled boost is available from Boost Consulting. When installing select the
multithreaded static libs.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtkmm/">gtkmm</a><br>
Install to "C:\gtkmm" or pkg-config won't work properly. The latest version
known to work is 2.16.0-4.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://python.org/download/">Python</a><br>
This is used to run the build system (SCons).
</p>

<p>
After installing the dependencies open cmd.exe, navigate to the source directory
and run "scons".
