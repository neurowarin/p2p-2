<b>1.0 Abstract</b>
<blockquote>
The libp2p library provides the means to connect to a global DHT (distributed
hash table) on which to lookup and download files from multiple hosts
concurrently.
</blockquote>

<b>2.0 Protocol</b>
<blockquote>
<p>
Summary:
<br>
The protocol is symmetric with the exception of the key exchange. Any message
can go in either direction. All numbers are encoded in big-endian. The protocol
is entirely binary.
</p>
<p>
VLI (Variable Length Integer):
<br>
VLIs are used to save space. VLIs are used when we know the maximum value the integer
must hold. We know the maximum block number of a file so we can use VLIs
when requesting blocks. VLIs are a minimum of 1 byte and a maximum of 8 bytes.
</p>
<p>
Hash vs Root Hash:
<br>
The hash is a hash of the file size (big-endian) followed by the root hash
(20 byte SHA1 hash). Refer to the hash tree section for documentation on the
root hash.
</p>
</blockquote>

<b>2.1 Key Exchange</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>
Each session starts with a Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange.

Host_A initiates a connection with Host_B.
g   = the generator both sides use that is always equal to 2
s_A = secret exponent of Host_A
s_B = secret exponent of Host_B
p   = prime Host_A generates that both sides use
r_A = result of Host_A, g^s_A % p
r_B = result of Host_B, g^s_B % p
k   = secret key
MiM = Man in the middle.
^   = exponentiation symbol
%   = modulo symbol

The section header indicates who sees what.
+-----------------+   +-----------------+   +-----------------+
|     Host_A      |   |       MiM       |   |      Host_B     |
+-----------------+   +-----------------+   +-----------------+
| k = r_B^s_A % p | = | g^(s_A*s_B) % p | = | r_A^s_B % p = k |
+-----------------+   +-----------------+   +-----------------+
</pre>

<br>

<fieldset>
<pre>
Step 0: Host_A sends p and r_A to Host_B.

+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|       P       |      r_A      |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  0    ...   15  16    ...   31
</pre>
</fieldset>

<br>

<fieldset>
<pre>
Step 1: Host_B receives what was sent in Step 0. Host_B sends r_B to Host_A.

+---+---+---+---+
|      r_B      |
+---+---+---+---+
  0    ...   15
</pre>
</fieldset>

<br>

<fieldset>
<pre>
Step 2: Host_A receives what was sent in Step 1.
Both sides now have all information needed to calculate the secret key.
</pre>
</fieldset>

<br>

<p>
The secret key is used to seed two KISS (created by George Marsaglia) PRNGs. One
PRNG is for sending and one is for receiving. Note that the KISS PRNG is not
cryptographically secure but this is okay because the goal is obfuscation and
not security. Key exchanges without a PKI (public key infrastructure) are
inherently insecure (vulnerable to man-in-the-middle).
</p>

<pre>
|------------------------------ k ------------------------------|
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|       x       |       y       |       z       |       c       |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15

//KISS
uint32_t x, y, z, c;
uint32 extract()
{
	uint64 t, a = 698769069;
	x = 69069 * x + 12345;
	y ^= (y << 13);
	y ^= (y >> 17);
	y ^= (y << 5);
	t = a * z + c;
	c = (t >> 32);
	return x + y + (z = t);
}
</pre>

<p>
After the PRNG is seeded all bytes sent and received are XOR'd against the
output of the PRNGs. The send PRNG of Host_A remains synchronized to the recv
PRNG of Host_B and vise versa.
</p>

<b>2.5 Pipelining</b>
<blockquote>
<p>
Pipelining is done by sending multiple requests, and a new request whenever a
response is received. This increases throughput because the sender will never be
idle waiting for a request.
</p>
<p>
The maximum allowed pipeline size is 16. This would saturate a link with a
delay throughput product of less than 163840 (10240 * 16) bytes. For example, a
6Mb/s connection would have to have a latency greater than 213ms to not
saturate. This number is highly arbitrary.
</p>
</blockquote>

<b>2.6 Hash Tree</b>
<blockquote>

<p>
Merkle Hash Trees are used to distribute downloading of hash data needed to
verify the integrity of file blocks. The hash function used to generate the
tree is SHA1.
</p>

<p>
The bottom row of the tree consists of hashes for every 10240 bytes of the file
(however the last block may be shorter). Every row above the bottom row consists
of hashes for blocks of 512 hashes (may be less if there isn't 512 hashes left
in the child row).
</p>

<p>
The hash on the top of the tree is the root hash. The file size (8 byte
big-endian) with the root hash appended are then hashed together to get the hash
the file is tracked by.
</p>
</blockquote>

<b>2.7 Limits</b>
<blockquote>
The maximum file size is 2^64 bytes.

Hash trees are currently stored in SQLite. SQLite blobs are limited to
2^31 - 1 bytes. Files which would generate hash trees larger than this won't be
hashed until this limitation can be addressed.
