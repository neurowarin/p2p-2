<h2>About</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
LibP2P does multi-source segmented downloading meaning that one file is
downloaded from multiple hosts concurrently to increase speed.
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>
<b>Bandwidth Efficiency:</b> Ratio of control and error detection data to file
data is kept as low as possible.
</p>

<p>
<b>Perfect Copies:</b> The integrity of files is checked with hash functions to
insure downloaded files are perfect copies of the original.
</p>

<p>
<b>Unpoisonable:</b> The presence of malicious peers has minimal impact on file
downloads.
</p>

<p>
<b>Obfuscation:</b> The protocol is obfuscated to make detecting the protocol
difficult. This does not take precedence over any other goal.
</p>

<p>
<b>Low Requirements:</b> CPU and memory usage is as low as is reasonable.
</p>

<h2>Protocol</h2>
<p>
The protocol is symmetric with the exception of the key exchange. Any message
can go in either direction. All numbers are big-endian.
</p>

<h3>Key Exchange</h2>
<pre>
Each session starts with a Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange.

Host_A initiates a connection with Host_B.
g   = the generator both sides use that is always equal to 2
s_A = secret exponent of Host_A
s_B = secret exponent of Host_B
p   = prime Host_A generates that both sides use
r_A = result of Host_A, g^s_A % p
r_B = result of Host_B, g^s_B % p
k   = secret key
MiM = Man in the middle.
^   = exponentiation symbol
%   = modulo symbol

The section header indicates who sees what.
+-----------------+   +-----------------+   +-----------------+
|     Host_A      |   |       MiM       |   |      Host_B     |
+-----------------+   +-----------------+   +-----------------+
| k = r_B^s_A % p | = | g^(s_A*s_B) % p | = | r_A^s_B % p = k |
+-----------------+   +-----------------+   +-----------------+
</pre>

Step 0: Host_A sends p and r_A to Host_B.

	+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
	|       P       |      r_A      |
	+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
	  0    ...   15   16   ...   31
</pre>
</fieldset>

<pre>
Step 1: Host_B receives what was sent in Step 0. Host_B sends r_B to Host_A.

	+---+---+---+---+
	|      r_B      |
	+---+---+---+---+
	  0    ...   15
</pre>
</fieldset>

<br>

<fieldset>
<pre>
Step 2: Host_A receives what was sent in Step 1.
Both sides now have all information needed to calculate the secret key.
</pre>
</fieldset>

<br>

<p>
The secret key is used to seed the KISS PRNG by George Marsaglia. This PRNG is
not cryptographically secure but that is unimportant since the key exchange is
done for the purpose of obfuscation, not security.
</p>

<pre>
/*
To seed the PRNG x, y, z, c must be set. We set these to the secret key.
x = k[0]  .. k[3]
y = k[4]  .. k[7]
z = k[8]  .. k[11]
c = k[12] .. k[15]
*/
uint32_t x, y, z, c;
uint54_t t, a = 698769069LL;
unsigned long KISS(){
	x = 69069 * x + 12345;
	y ^= (y << 13);
	y ^= (y >> 17);
	y ^= (y << 5);
	t = a * z + c;
	c = (t >> 32);
	return x + y + (z = t);
}

<h2>Pipelining</h2>
<p>
Pipelining is done by sending multiple requests, and a new request whenever a
response is received. This increases throughput because the sender will never be
idle waiting for a request.
</p>
<p>
The maximum allowed pipeline size is 16.
</p>
<h3>
Adaptive Pipeline Sizing Algorithm:
</h3>
<p>
This simple algorithm reduces the size of the pipeline to the minimum needed
without reducing throughput.
</p>
<pre>
Run after request fulfilled to adjust pipeline size.

C = current requests unfulfilled (requests in pipeline)
M = maximum pipeline size (this is what we adjust)
A = absolute maximum pipeline size (M always < A)

case: C == 0 && M < A
	//pipeline is too small, increase by one
	++M
case: C == 1
	//pipeline size optimal, do nothing
case: C > 1 && M > 1
	//pipeline is too large, decrease by one
	--M;
</pre>

<h2>Building</h2>

<h3>GNU/Linux</h3>
<p>
There are many different GNU/Linux distributions. Most likely you can use your
package manager to install the developer versions of these packages: boost, and
gtkmm.
</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/">Visual C++ Express 2008</a><br>
The command line compiler will be used by scons. It is not necessary to register
unless one wants to use the IDE.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.boostpro.com/products/free">Boost</a> &#62;= 1.36<br>
Precompiled boost is available from Boost Consulting. When installing select the
multithreaded static libs.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtkmm/">gtkmm</a><br>
Install to "C:\gtkmm" or pkg-config won't work properly. The latest version
known to work is 2.16.0-4.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://python.org/download/">Python</a><br>
This is used to run the build system (SCons).
</p>

<p>
After installing the dependencies open cmd.exe, navigate to the source directory
and run "scons".
