<h2>About</h2>
<p>
LibP2P does multi-source segmented downloading meaning that one file is
downloaded from multiple hosts concurrently to increase speeds.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bandwidth Efficiency:</b><br>
Ratio of control and error detection data to file data is kept as low as
possible.
</p>

<p>
<b>Perfect Copies:</b><br>
The integrity of files is checked with hash functions to insure downloaded files
are perfect copies.
</p>

<p>
<b>Unpoisonable:</b><br>
The presence of malicious peers has minimal impact on file downloads.
</p>

<p>
<b>Obfuscation:</b><br>
The protocol is obfuscated to make detecting the protocol difficult. This does
not take precedence over any other goal.
</p>

<p>
<b>Low Requirements:</b><br>
CPU and memory usage is as low as is reasonable.
</p>

<h2>Protocol</h2>
<p>
The protocol is symmetric with the exception of the key exchange. Any message
can go in either direction. Messages are fixed length. Each command has an
associated message length.

<h3>Pipelining</h3>
<p>
The maximum pipeline size is 8 requests.
</p>
<p>
Pipelining is done by sending multiple requests when a download starts and a new
request whenever a response is received such that there are always requests
"in the pipeline". Pipelining makes it so the server is never sitting idle
waiting for a request.
