	add_block_local (one paramter):
		Add block. Used when next_request was not involved in getting a block.
		This function is used during hash check to mark what blocks we already
		have.
	add_block_local (two parameters):
		Add block from specific host.
	add_block_local_all:
		Adds all local blocks.
		Postcondition: complete() = true, all requests cleared (so no rerequests
			are done on timeout).
	add_block_remote:
		Add block that we know remote host has.
	add_host_complete:
		Add remote host that has all blocks.
	add_host_incomplete:
		Add remote host that has only some blocks.
	approve_block:
		Approve block for requesting. Blocks that aren't approved won't be
		requested.
	bytes:
		Returns size of bit_field. (bytes)
	complete:
		Returns true if we have all blocks.
	force_complete:
		Sets block request to indicate that we have all blocks.
	have_block:
		Returns true if we have specified block.
	next_request:
		Returns true and sets block to next block to request. Or returns false if
		host not yet added or no blocks to request from host.
		Precondition: !complete()
	remove_host:
		Remove host as source for blocks. Any blocks requested from this host are
		rerequested.
	remote_host_count:
		Returns the number of remote hosts block_request is keeping track of.
	request_zero:
		Function which requests block 0. This is needed for the hash tree
		block_request when making a slot request.
