	add_block_local:
		Adds a block that we have that does not need to be requested. This is
		called when we hash check and discover that a block is good.
		Note: If the block is not from anyone, for example if it hash checked good
			during resume, then use -1 as the connection_ID.
	add_block_remote:
		Adds a block that a remote host has. This is called when a remote host
		tells us it got a new block.
	add_host_complete:
		Adds a remote host that has all blocks available.
	add_host_incomplete:
		Adds a bitset for a remote host. This function is used when the remote
		host sends us a bitfield because it doesn't have all blocks.
	append_bitfield:
		Appends our bitfield to buffer. The appended bitfield is big-endian.
	bytes:
		Returns the size of the bit_field (bytes).
	complete:
		Returns true if we have all blocks.
	have_block:
		Returns true if we have the specified block.
	next_request:
		Returns true and sets block to the number of the next block we need to
		request from the remote host. If returns false then the remote host has no
		blocks we need or we are waiting on a bit_field from the host.
		Precondition: !complete()
	remove_host:
		Removes bit_field for host. This is done when a host disconnects or when
		we stop downloading the file from them. Any unfulfilled requests are
		immediately rerequested.
		Precondition: host must have been previously added.
	rerequest_block:
		This function is called when we receive a bad block but we don't know who
		it is from. When this happens we need to "re"request the block from any
		host. This function is commonly called when reassembling a hash tree.
