	block_size:
		Returns the size of a hash block. This is used to know what to expect from
		a hash block request.
	check:
		If the tree is not complete the check function should be called to
		determine what blocks are good.
		Note: This function may take a long time to run.
	check_file_block:
		Checks a file block against a hash in the hash tree. Returns GOOD if file
		block good. Returns BAD if file block bad. Returns IO_ERROR if cannot read
		hash tree.
		Precondition: The complete function must return true.
	complete:
		Returns true if the hash tree is complete. Complete means that all hashes
		have been checked good. If this funtion returns false then the missing
		block to request should be gotten from Block_Request. It should be noted
		that Block_Request can be complete and the hash_tree not complete if the
		request for the last blocks were made, but not yet received.
	create:
		Create a hash tree. Returns good if tree created or tree already existed.
		Returns bad if hash tree could never be created. Returns io_error if
		io_error occured (such as file changing size, temp files failing to read,
		etc). When an io_error occurs the file is generally retried later.
		Precondition: FI.path and FI.file_size must be correctly set.
		Postcondition: FI.hash set unless io_error returned.
		Note: If hash tree creation suceeds the hash tree state will only be set
			to RESERVED. If it's not changed the tree will be deleted upon next
			program start.
	read_block:
		Get block from hash tree. Returns GOOD if suceeded. Returns IO_ERROR if
		cannot read hash tree.
	write_block:
		Add or replace block in hash tree. Returns good if block was written,
		io_error if block could not be written, or bad if the block hash failed.
		The connection_ID is needed for block_request.

	block_info:
		Requires a block number, and row info. Sets info.first to byte offset
		to start of hash block and info.second to hash block length. Parent is
		set to offset of start of parent hash.
		Note: If block is 0 then parent won't be set.
		Note: A version that doesn't set parent is available.
	file_size_to_file_hash:
		Given file size (size of actual file, not hash tree), returns the
		number of file hashes (bottom row of tree).
	file_size_to_tree_size:
		Given a file_size, returns tree size (bytes).
	file_hash_to_tree_hash:
		Given the file hash count returns the number of hashes in tree. Populates
		row with how many hashes are in each row of the tree.
	row_to_block_count:
		Given tree row information, returns hash block count (total number of
		hash blocks in tree).
	row_to_file_hash_offset:
		Returns the byte offset to the start of the file hashes.
