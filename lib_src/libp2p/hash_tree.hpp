		Checks a file block against a hash in the hash tree. Returns good if file
		block good. Returns bad if file block bad. Returns io_error if cannot read

	create:
		Create hash tree. Returns good if tree created or already existed. Returns
		bad if tree could never be created. Returns io_error if an error occured
		reading the tree or temp files.
		Note: If tree created the tree state will be set to reserved. This must
			be set to complete or tree will be deleted on next program start.
	read_block:
		Get block from hash tree. Returns good if suceeded. Returns io_error if
		cannot read hash tree.
	write_block:
		Add or replace block in hash tree. Returns good if block was written,
		io_error if block could not be written, or bad if the block hash failed.

		Given a file_size, returns tree size (bytes).
	file_hash_to_tree_hash:
		Given the file hash count returns the number of hashes in tree. Populates

	row_to_block_count:
		Given tree row information, returns hash block count (total number of
		hash blocks in tree).
