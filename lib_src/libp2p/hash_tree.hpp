	block_size:
		Returns the size of a hash block. This is used to know what to expect from
		a hash block request.
	check:
		Checks the entire hash tree. This is called on program start to see what
		blocks are good.
	check_block:
		Checks the hash tree block in buf.
	check_file_block:
		Checks a file block against a hash in the hash tree. Returns good if file
		block good. Returns bad if file block bad. Returns io_error if cannot read
		hash tree.
		Precondition: The complete function must return true.
	create:
		Create hash tree. Returns good if tree created or already existed. Returns
		bad if tree could never be created. Returns io_error if an error occured
		reading the tree or temp files.
		Note: If tree created the tree state will be set to reserved. This must
			be set to complete or tree will be deleted on next program start.
		Note: The create function modifies const data members.
	file_block_children:
		Returns hash tree block children of specified hash tree block. Second
		element of pair set to true if block has children.
		std::pair<first child in range, one past last child in range>
	read_block:
		Get block from hash tree. Returns good if suceeded (and block appended to
		buf). Returns io_error if cannot read hash tree.
	tree_block_children:
		Returns file block children of specified hash tree block. Second element
		of pair set to true if hash tree block has file block children.
		std::pair<first child in range, one past last child in range>
	write_block:
		Add or replace block in hash tree. Returns good if block was written,
		io_error if block could not be written, or bad if the block hash failed.
		The connection_ID is needed for block_request.
		Precondition: Parent hash must have been written.
		Note: This function does not check validity of root_hash (block 0).
