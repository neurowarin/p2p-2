What is 'size_t'?
===============
size_t is typically (but not always) defined as a unsigned integer that is large
enough to hold a memory address.


When should I use 'size_t'?
=========================
size_t (or std::size_t) should be used to hold the result of sizeof(). It should
be used whenever specifying the size of memory in bytes.
