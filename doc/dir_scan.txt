Directory scanning is used instead of a event service to monitor shares for file
updates. This is inefficient. Other systems have not been fully researched but
what is known is listed in this document.

Linux inotify
=============
Limit
-----
Available on >= Linux 2.6.13.

Limit
-----
Maximum 8192 directories can be watched. This can be increased by
writing to /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches.

From the inotifywatch 3.12 man page.
"If you use this option while watching the root directory of a large tree, it may
take quite a while until all inotify watches are established, and events will
not be received in this time. Also, since one inotify watch will be established
per subdirectory, it is possible that the maximum amount of inotify watches per
user will be reached. The default maximum is 8192; it can be increased by
writing to /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches."
