What is 'inline'?
=================
The inline keyword is a hint to the compiler that a function should be inlined.
It is a hint because even if you specify it the function may not be inlined.

When should I use 'inline'?
===========================
Like any optimization inline should not be used unless a performance advantage
can be measured. There are generally compiler warnings that can be enabled to
warn if a inline keyword is ignored.
