Can a static data member be instantiated in a header?
=====================================================
yes!


Const integral types
====================
If the static data member is of const integral type it can be done like this.

class test
{
	static const int i(2);
};


Other types
===========
If the static data member is not of const integral type a dummy template type
can be used. Note that this is not thread safe.

template<typename DUMMY=int>
class test
{
	static std::string str;
};
template<typename DUMMY> std::string test<DUMMY>::str("ABC");
