What is a class tag?
====================
A class tag is a comment near the top of a class header file which lists basic
attributes of a class.

Grammar of tags:
<base> = "//tags: "<tag_line>
<tag_line> = <tag>|<tag><tag_line>|""

Example:
//tags: monitor


Types of class tags.

to consider the implications of disk latency on the calling thread.

concurrently.

threaded_call_back
-----
Class has internal threads which it uses to do call backs.
