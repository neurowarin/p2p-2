Sybil Attack
============
A Sybil attack is when one host identifies itself as multiple hosts for the
purpose of disrupting the normal operation of a network.

It's trivial to stage a Sybil attack on a stock Kad network. All that's required
is to send many ping messages with different IDs. The Kad routing table will get
filled with entries all pointing to the same host.

There are many different ways to mitigate Sybil attacks.

Require Unique Addresses
------------------------
Require that every address in the routing table is unique, or close to unique.
Because UDP source addresses are trivially forged only IDs we get as a result of
a ping request should be added to the routing table. The randomly generated
number included in the ping request acts like a token which allows the host to
add it's ID to our routing table.

Require Unique Networks
-----------------------
Populate the routing table such that it has as many networks as possible. In
other words populate the routing table such that IPs are distributed as close to
random uniform as possible. An abusive host will likely be on the same network
as other abusive hosts. One exception to the effectiveness of this is if the
attacker controls a botnet. Then we're screwed.

Make ID non-Trivial to Acquire
------------------------------
If the ID were sent in the ping message it would be easy for an attacker to
target a specific k-bucket in which to put a Sybil. To mitigate this don't send
the ID until necessary (after TCP establishment only). This way it becomes more
difficult to target specific k-buckets.


Flooding
========
Flooding is when a host sends messages at a very high rate. This can degrade
performance for everyone if we try to respond to every message. The solution to
this is to associate a rate limit with the IP addresses of incoming messages.

Because the source address of a UDP packet can be forged this will allow a
posible DOS. For example if host A (attacker) spoofs B (victim), and then host A
intentionally floods C (a Kad server host B wants to use), then B will be unable
to communicate with C. However, this attack is not very practical under real
world conditions because A generally wouldn't know what address to spoof.

When the rate limit is reached for a host incoming messages from them can be
silently dropped.
