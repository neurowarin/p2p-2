Load File Format
================

There are two different file formats that can be used to start a download. One
file format downloads a single file. The other file format downloads a
directory. The name of the files for both formats must end in ".p2p".

Single File
-----------
File downloaded will be the name of the load file without the ".p2p". For
example "foo.avi.p2p" downloads file "foo.avi".

The file must contain the file hash (40 byte hex).


Directory
---------
Directory downloaded will be the name of the load file without the ".p2p". For
example "bar.p2p" downloads directory "bar".

The file must contain lines which consist of the file hash (40 byte hex)
followed by the file name (255 char max). Both types of line breaks are
supported ("\n" and "\r\n").

Example (file named "test.p2p"):
DEADBEEFDEADBEEFDEADBEEFDEADBEEFDEADBEEFfoo.avi
0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF01234567bar.avi

This would create a directory named "test" and download "foo.avi" and "bar.avi"
in to it.
