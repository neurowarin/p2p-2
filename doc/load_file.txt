Load File Format
================

Load File Rules:
1. The name of the load file must end in ".p2p".
2. The load file must contain hash (40 byte hex) path pairs (the hash followed by
the path). Each line ends with "\n" or "\r\n".

Path Rules:
1. A maximum of one file or one directory can be created within the users
download directory. This is to stop a load file from polluting the users
download directory and making it difficult for the user to find anything.
2. File and directory names are a maximum of 255 characters. When generating a
load file additional characters should be truncated.
3. File extensions are all lower case. When generating a load file upper case
file extensions should be converted to lower case. For example "foo.ZIP" ->
"foo.zip".
4. File and directory names must not end with period(s). When generating a load
file files or directories ending with period(s) should have the period(s)
truncated
5. File and directory names are case sensitive on platforms that support it.
When a naming conflict is found on a case insensitive platform one of the files
or directories should be renamed in such a way that preserves the original name.
For example, "foo.avi" -> "foo_1.avi".
6. Paths must begin with a valid file or directory name.
7. Paths can not contain "..". Directory traversal is not allowed.
8. If a directory or file naming conflict is found in the top level download
directory the directory or file name should be renamed in such a way that
preserves the original file name. For example, "foo" -> "foo_1".
9. Directories in a path are delimited by '/'.
10. Empty directories and files should have their hash set to all periods.
11. The following characters are allowed in directory and file names:
${}^[]`=,;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ._- 0123456789
note: Spaces are allowed in both directories and file names.
12. All paths in a load file must be unique (the hashes don't need to be).

Parsing
=======

Load files should be strictly parsed. If the load file is malformed nothing from
within it should be loaded without user intervention.
