/*
Download Interface Specification:

-The full response to the latest request is passed to this.
void response(string & response)

-Should return true when the download is complete(triggers download removal).
bool is_complete()

-How many bytes are expected in response to the latest request.
unsigned int bytes_expected()

-Size of the download.
unsigned int size()

-Name of the download.
string name()

-Unique ID of the download.
string hash()

-Return a string with a complete request(to be sent over wire).
string new_request()

-Current speed of the download in bytes/second.
unsigned int speed()

-When this is called the download needs to prepare to stop(is_complete should
return true when ready to stop). Do not signal complete until a full response 
to the last request was received, do not allow new requests.
void stop()

-When a new server is connected register with this function.
void reg_conn(std::string server_IP)

-When a server disconnects it will be unregisted with the download.
void unreg_conn(std::string server_IP)

-After a packet is received this function should be called with the parameter of 
how many bytes were received.
void calculate_speed(const int & bytes)


Missing Functionality
-The ability to handle errors, when a full response isn't sent. Perhaps make a
function to return the size of a potential error message.
