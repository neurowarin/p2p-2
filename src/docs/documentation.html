<h2>About</h2>
<p>
&#60;name&#62; is a P2P(peer-to-peer) multi-source file sharing program with
it's own protocol. P2P means that the program contains both a client and a
server which allows you to share your files and download files from others at
the same time. Multi-source means that you can download one file from multiple
peers at the same time.

<a name="about_goals">
<h3>Goals</h3>
<h4>Low System Requirements</h4>
<blockquote>
CPU and memory usage should be as low as possible.
</blockquote>

<h4>Protocol Efficiency</h4>
<blockquote>
Ratio of control and error detection data to file data should be as low as
possible.
</blockquote>

<h4>Obfuscation</h4>
<blockquote>
The protocol should be obfuscated to make detecting the protocol difficult.
This should not take precedence over other goals, such as Low System
Requirements and Protocol Efficiency.
</blockquote>

<h4>Location Aware</h4>
<blockquote>
Closer servers should be favored when downloading files.

<a name="protocol">
<h2>Protocol</h2>
<p>
&#60;name&#62; is a client/server protocol. The client sends requests to the
server and the server responds. Each request sent to the server begins with a 1
byte command. There are two types of requests, text and binary. 
</p>

<br>

<p><b>Binary:</b></p>
<p>
Binary requests are fixed length. The server determines the length of a binary
request by looking at the command. Responses to binary requests are binary and
fixed length. The client determines the length of a binary response by looking
at the command.
</p>
<p>
example:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
  0   1                0   1   2   3   4   5
+---+---+            +---+---+---+---+---+---+
| C |   |            | C |                   |
+---+---+            +---+---+---+---+---+---+
 request                  response
</pre>
</blockquote>

<br>

<p><b>Text:</b></p>
<p>
Text requests are fixed length. The server determines the length of a text
request by looking at the command. Responses to text requests are text and are
variable length. The client determines the end end of a text response by looking
for a \0 terminator. There is no command in a text response.
</p>
<p>example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
  0   1                0   1   .........   n
+---+---+            +---+---+---+---+---+---+
| C |   |            |                    \0 |
+---+---+            +---+---+---+---+---+---+
 request                  response
</pre>

<a name="pipelining">
<h3>Pipelining</h3>
<p>
The maximum pipeline size is 8 requests.
</p>
<p>
Pipelining is done by sending multiple requests when a download starts and a new
request whenever a response is received such that there are always requests
"in the pipeline". Pipelining makes it so the server is never sitting idle
waiting for a request.
</p>

<br><hr width="100" align="left">

<a name="rerequests">
<h3>Rerequests</h3>
<p>
The following trigger rerequesting of file blocks:
<br><br>
- If a request is not fulfilled within 16 seconds a rerequest will be done.
<br>
- Server disconnect triggers rerequest of all requests in pipeline.
<br>
- Hash failure triggers blacklisting of server and rerequest of all requests in
pipline.
</p>

<br><hr width="100" align="left">

<a name="blacklist">
<h3>Blacklist</h3>
<p>
When a client or server disobeys the protocol it will be blacklisted. Any established
connections to the server are immediately severed. The following trigger blacklisting:
<br><br>
- Unexpected commands, unknown commands, and commands out of sequence.
<br>
- Overpiplining from the client.
<br>
- Buffer overrun. Malformed commands generally lead the the client/server not being
able to delimit commands which leads to buffer overruns.
<br>
- Server sending a block which fails a hash check.

This message is sent in response to a REQUEST_SLOT_FILE or a REQUEST_SLOT_HASH.
Contained within this response is a slot ID that can be used to request blocks
from a file.

<fieldset>
<pre>
C: WAIT
B: 6
D: server -> client

<p>
The server is currently downloading the file and doesn't yet have the block
that was requested. This triggers an 8 second wait before trying to request
any new blocks.
