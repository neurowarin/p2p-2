Kademelia network.

Each node maintains a list for each bit in a GUID.

The lists are for commonality.

Example:
My GUID
1 0 1 0 1 1

GUID to insert
1 0 1 1 1 1

The first 3 bits are the same so the host would go in the third list.

The GUIDS should be chosen geographically so that nodes nearer to eachother in
the overlay are nearer to eachother in the world. Can longitude be used?

GUID
<longitude 1-byte><time 4-byte><MAC 6-byte>
