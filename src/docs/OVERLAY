XOR key distance metric

Having the GUIDS and the root hashes be the same length and then
storing root hashes on hosts which are "close" to the root hashes (by XOR'ing
their GUID against the root hash) a la Kademlia.

There needs to be a way to order the network by real distance (possibly measured
by a trace route).

Skip list is an idea that permeates all the overlay schemes I've seen.

Could a chord network be setup where you locate a ring in your geographical area
and only query that?

Ring of rings.

Overlay needs to factor in distance/latency.

If other types of data are to be searchable over the network could the protocol
be set up to support different kinds of search "objects". Like file name, size,
bitrate, etc?
