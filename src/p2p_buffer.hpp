	/* Functions for managing connections.
	add_connection:
		Adds a p2p_buffer for a specified socket. Should be called whenever a
		socket is created. This may be called multiple times for the same socket
		and a p2p_buffer will only be created on the first call. The initiator
		parameter controls whether or not we start the key negotiation. If we
		initiate the connection then initiator should equal true.
	erase:
		Erases p2p_buffer associated with socket_FD. This should be called
		whenever a socket is disconnected.
	get_empty:
		Removes all empty p2p_buffers and populates disconnect vector with
		sockets which need to be disconnected.
	get_send_buff:
		Copies max_bytes from the p2p_buffer send_buff in to the destination
		buff. True is returned if destination is not empty after function completes.
		Note 1: max_bytes should be as low as possible to avoid unnecessary copying.
		Note 2: Once a send is done, call post_send to erase the bytes sent from the
		p2p_buffer send_buff.
	get_send_pending:
		Returns counter that indicates how many sockets have bytes to send. Used by
		client to check if write_FDS set should be used.
	get_timed_out:
		Removes p2p_buffers that timed out and populates timed_out vector with
		sockets which should be disconnected.
	is_connected:
		Returns true if there is a connection to the specified IP.
	new_connection:
		Adds download to p2p_buffer. Creates new p2p_buffer if necessary.
		Silently fails if the download within download_connection doesn't exist in
		Unique_Download.
	post_send:
		Should always be called after sending data obtained from get_send_buff().
		This function erases the send_buff data in the p2p_buffer that was sent.
		If returns true then the socket should be disconnected.
	post_recv:
		Should always be called after recv'ing data. Processes recv'ed data.
	process:
		Gives the p2p_buffer time to do necessary processing. Should be called
		before the socket servicing loop.

	current_downloads:
		Populates the info vector with download status information. If hash is

		Note: the info vector is cleared before it's populated
	get_complete:
		Populates complete vector with complete downloads. Removes complete
		downloads from all p2p_buffers and Unique_Download.

		Returns true if download specified by pointer or hash is running.
	pause_download:
		Stops download from making further requests. Does not disconnect servers,
		but servers may be disconnected if no other downloads are active with them.
	remove_download:
		Removes the download associated with hash.
	remove_download_connection:
		Disassociate a server with a download.
