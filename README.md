P2P Project (defunct)
===

####History
This was my side project while in school. At the time I made this I had a good
understanding of the C++ programming language but I was not yet a good
programmer. I made several mistakes including: creating a custom binary
protocol, creating my own version of protocol buffers, and creating my own async
networking library. In the years since I created this I've started to value
simplicity and testing more than this project would indicate.

####Status
This project is able to be run under very controlled conditions. It can locate
peers for a file in a Kademlia DHT, download the hash tree for the file, and
then download the file.
