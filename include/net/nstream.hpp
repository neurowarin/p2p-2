	is_open_async:
		After open_async we must wait for the socket to become writeable. When it
		is we can call this to see if the connection succeeded.
		WARNING: If this is called before the socket becomes writeable we can have
			a false negative.
	local_ep:
		Returns local endpoint. Returns nothing if not connected, or if ep could
		not be determined.
		Note: endpoints returned for current or latest connection.
	open:
		Opens connection. Blocks until connection established.
	open_async:
		Start async connection. The socket must be monitored by select. When it
		becomes writeable is_open_async() should be called to determine if the
		socket connected, or failed to connect.
	recv:
		Read bytes in to buffer. Returns the number of bytes read, 0 if the host
		disconnected, or -1 on error.
	remote_ep:
		Returns remote endpoint, or nothing if couldn't be determined.
	send:
		Write bytes from buffer. Returns the number of bytes sent, 0 if the
		host disconnected, or -1 on error. The sent bytes are erased from the
		buffer.
