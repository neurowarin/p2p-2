TODO

-inet_ntop not supported on xp/2003

-Think about moving Socket_Data to reactor class and having protected accessor
functions which lock it.

-make request generator unit test


THINK ABOUT

-Using new primes must be forced. To do this old primes must be kept track of.

DEFERRED FEATURES

-requests should be sent before file blocks, when two hosts download from
eachother the file blocks hog upload that should be used to get requests out.
-SQLite blob write offset is a signed int. This limits the maximum tree size
to 2gB. Create document like this: http://www.sqlite.org/limits.html with size
limits.
-Support for multiple share directories.
-Figure out how to handle naming conflicts. It should be fully automatic.
Probably just rename the files according to some rules. It doesn't matter too
much since the hashes stay the same.
-Have a tab that shows share stats, upload/download stats, duplicate files, etc.
-Make sure program works when out of hard drive space.
